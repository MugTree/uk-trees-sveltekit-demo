However, it remains a beloved species for its height and graceful shape, and efforts are being made to restore its presence in the landscape.</em></p> <!----><p>The elm tree (Ulmus) was once one of the most widespread trees in Britain, known for its distinctive vase-like shape and serrated leaves. Elms can grow up to 35 meters tall and live for hundreds of years. However, in the 20th century, the species was devastated by Dutch elm disease, caused by a fungus spread by bark beetles, which killed millions of trees across Europe and North America.</p> <p>Despite this, elm trees still hold a significant place in British culture and ecology. They were often planted along streets and in parks for their ornamental beauty and the shade they provide. Their strong, interlocking grain made elm wood useful in boatbuilding and furniture making, as it resists splitting even when wet. Although Dutch elm disease remains a challenge, some resistant varieties have been developed, offering hope for the future of this iconic tree.</p> <p>Today, conservationists continue to explore ways to protect and reintroduce elms to the British landscape. While much of the elm population has been lost, its legacy endures in older specimens and new plantings, and its role in supporting wildlifeâ€”such as providing habitat for butterflies and birdsâ€”remains significant.</p><!----> <div class="clear"></div></section> <section><div><h2>Elm trees in context</h2></div> <div class="databox"><div class="left"><table class="striped"><thead><tr><th>Tree</th><th>Max Age (y)</th><th>Max Height (m)</th><th>Est. number</th></tr></thead><tbody><!--[--><tr><td><span>Ash</span></td><td>250</td><td>35</td><td>80 million</td></tr><tr><td><span>Beech</span></td><td>350</td><td>40</td><td>10 million</td></tr><tr><td><span class="selected">Elm</span></td><td>400</td><td>35</td><td>10 thousand</td></tr><tr><td><span>Fir</span></td><td>500</td><td>60</td><td>1 million</td></tr><tr><td><span>Oak</span></td><td>1000</td><td>40</td><td>120 million</td></tr><tr><td><span>Pine</span></td><td>500</td><td>45</td><td>100 million</td></tr><!--]--></tbody></table><!----></div> <div class="right"><div id="treemap" style="width: 340px; height: 340px; position: relative; margin: 24px auto 0 auto;" class="leaflet-container leaflet-touch leaflet-retina leaflet-fade-anim leaflet-grab leaflet-touch-drag leaflet-touch-zoom" tabindex="0"></div> <p class="caption">Elm trees in the UK</p><!----></div></div></section> <section><h2 class="spacer">Questions about Elm trees</h2> <hr> <!--[--><details><summary><b>What is the primary threat to Elm trees in the UK?</b></summary> <p>The primary threat to Elm trees in the UK is Dutch elm disease, a fungal infection spread by bark beetles.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>How tall can Elm trees grow?</b></summary> <p>Elm trees can grow up to 35 meters tall.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What are some uses of Elm wood?</b></summary> <p>Elm wood is prized for its resistance to splitting, making it useful for boatbuilding, furniture, and even coffins.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>Are there any resistant varieties of Elm trees?</b></summary> <p>Yes, some resistant varieties of Elm have been developed to combat Dutch elm disease, offering hope for their restoration.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What wildlife benefits from Elm trees?</b></summary> <p>Elm trees provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds, butterflies, and insects that thrive on its leaves and bark.</p></details> <hr><!--]--></section> <section><h2 class="spacer">Other trees</h2> <ul><!--[--><li><a href="ash">Ash</a></li><li><a href="beech">Beech</a></li><li><a href="elm">Elm</a></li><li><a href="fir">Fir</a></li><li><a href="oak">Oak</a></li><li><a href="pine">Pine</a></li><!--]--></ul></section><!----><!----></section></main> <footer class="container"><hr> <p>2024</p></footer><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
