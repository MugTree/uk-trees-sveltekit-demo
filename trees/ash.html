It can live for hundreds of years, reaching impressive heights. In British folklore, the ash tree has long been associated with protection and healing.</em></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nfwi79">The ash tree (Fraxinus excelsior) is one of the most prominent deciduous trees in the UK, recognized by its pinnate leaves and distinctive black buds. It is native to Europe and plays a critical role in supporting local biodiversity, providing habitat for various insects, birds, and fungi. Ash trees are also famous for their rapid growth, often reaching heights of up to 35 meters.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1el0lnr">Culturally, the ash has deep roots in British history and mythology. It was believed that ash trees could ward off serpents and evil spirits. The treeâ€™s wood is highly valued for its strength and flexibility, historically used for making tools, furniture, and even early airplanes. Unfortunately, the species is currently threatened by ash dieback, a fungal disease that has devastated populations across Europe.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-rzj919">Despite these challenges, conservation efforts are underway to protect ash trees and develop resistant strains. The treeâ€™s resilience and importance to the ecosystem make it a symbol of endurance. Its striking appearance and cultural significance ensure its place as a beloved part of the British landscape, even in the face of environmental threats.</p> <div class="clear"></div></section> <section><div><h2>Ash trees in context</h2></div> <div class="databox"><div class="left"><table class="striped"><thead data-svelte-h="svelte-9c7ieg"><tr><th>Tree</th> <th>Max Age (y)</th> <th>Max Height (m)</th> <th>Est. number</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><span class="selected">Ash</span></td> <td>250</td> <td>35</td> <td>80 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Beech</span></td> <td>350</td> <td>40</td> <td>10 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Elm</span></td> <td>400</td> <td>35</td> <td>10 thousand</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Fir</span></td> <td>500</td> <td>60</td> <td>1 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Oak</span></td> <td>1000</td> <td>40</td> <td>120 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Pine</span></td> <td>500</td> <td>45</td> <td>100 million</td> </tr></tbody></table></div> <div class="right">  <div id="treemap" style="width: 340px; height: 340px; position: relative; margin: 24px auto 0 auto; " class="leaflet-container leaflet-touch leaflet-retina leaflet-fade-anim leaflet-grab leaflet-touch-drag leaflet-touch-zoom" tabindex="0"></div> <p class="caption">Ash trees in the UK</p></div></div></section> <section><h2 class="spacer">Questions about Ash trees</h2> <hr> <details><summary><b>What is the scientific name of the Ash tree?</b></summary> <p>The scientific name of the Ash tree is Fraxinus excelsior.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>How tall can an Ash tree grow?</b></summary> <p>Ash trees can grow up to 35 meters tall.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>Why is the Ash tree important in British folklore?</b></summary> <p>In British folklore, the Ash tree is believed to have protective qualities and has been associated with healing and warding off evil spirits.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What disease is currently threatening Ash trees in the UK?</b></summary> <p>Ash dieback, a fungal disease caused by *Hymenoscyphus fraxineus*, is currently threatening Ash trees in the UK.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>How long can Ash trees live?</b></summary> <p>Ash trees can live for up to 250 years, though some may live even longer in favorable conditions.</p></details> <hr></section> <section><h2 class="spacer" data-svelte-h="svelte-6btogu">Other trees</h2> <ul><li><a href="ash">Ash</a></li><li><a href="beech">Beech</a></li><li><a href="elm">Elm</a></li><li><a href="fir">Fir</a></li><li><a href="oak">Oak</a></li><li><a href="pine">Pine</a></li></ul></section></section></main> <footer class="container" data-svelte-h="svelte-5to0xk"><hr> <p>2024</p></footer>
