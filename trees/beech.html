Known for its vibrant autumn colours, the beech is a symbol of wisdom and longevity in British culture.</em></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1uljamk">The beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) is one of Britain’s most beautiful deciduous trees, known for its smooth, silver-grey bark and spreading canopy. Reaching heights of up to 40 meters, beech trees can live for around 350 years. In autumn, they are particularly striking, with their leaves turning vibrant shades of orange and brown, making them a favourite among nature lovers.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1g70ftu">Beech trees are often found in well-drained soils across southern England, where their roots form expansive networks. These trees play a crucial role in forest ecosystems, providing food for various species, including birds, mammals, and insects. The nuts, known as beech mast, are a vital food source for wildlife.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-nvt0h7">Beech wood has historically been used for furniture, tools, and flooring due to its fine texture and durability. Beech trees are also steeped in cultural significance, often symbolizing knowledge and patience. They feature in British folklore as wise old trees, offering shelter and wisdom to those who rest beneath their branches. Today, beech forests remain a treasured part of the British landscape, known for their beauty and ecological importance.</p> <div class="clear"></div></section> <section><div><h2>Beech trees in context</h2></div> <div class="databox"><div class="left"><table class="striped"><thead data-svelte-h="svelte-9c7ieg"><tr><th>Tree</th> <th>Max Age (y)</th> <th>Max Height (m)</th> <th>Est. number</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><span class="">Ash</span></td> <td>250</td> <td>35</td> <td>80 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="selected">Beech</span></td> <td>350</td> <td>40</td> <td>10 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Elm</span></td> <td>400</td> <td>35</td> <td>10 thousand</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Fir</span></td> <td>500</td> <td>60</td> <td>1 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Oak</span></td> <td>1000</td> <td>40</td> <td>120 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Pine</span></td> <td>500</td> <td>45</td> <td>100 million</td> </tr></tbody></table></div> <div class="right"> </div></div></section> <section><h2 class="spacer">Questions about Beech trees</h2> <hr> <details><summary><b>How long can Beech trees live?</b></summary> <p>Beech trees can live up to 350 years, although some specimens can live even longer.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What makes Beech trees distinctive?</b></summary> <p>Beech trees are known for their smooth, grey bark, broad spreading canopies, and their vibrant autumn colours.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>Where are Beech trees commonly found in the UK?</b></summary> <p>Beech trees are commonly found in well-drained soils across southern England, especially in beech woodlands.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What are some uses of Beech wood?</b></summary> <p>Beech wood is known for its fine texture and durability, making it useful for furniture, tools, and flooring.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What role do Beech trees play in British culture?</b></summary> <p>Beech trees symbolize wisdom and patience in British culture, often featuring in folklore as wise old trees that offer shelter and guidance.</p></details> <hr></section> <section><h2 class="spacer" data-svelte-h="svelte-6btogu">Other trees</h2> <ul><li><a href="ash">Ash</a></li><li><a href="beech">Beech</a></li><li><a href="elm">Elm</a></li><li><a href="fir">Fir</a></li><li><a href="oak">Oak</a></li><li><a href="pine">Pine</a></li></ul></section></section></main> <footer class="container" data-svelte-h="svelte-5to0xk"><hr> <p>2024</p></footer>
