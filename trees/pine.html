Native to many parts of the UK, pines thrive in a variety of soils and climates, making them a versatile and vital component of British forests.</em></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-rh5ihg">The Pine tree (Pinus) is one of the most adaptable and resilient trees found in the UK, thriving in a wide range of climates and soils. Known for its evergreen foliage, pines can grow up to 45 meters tall and live for over 500 years. Pine trees are especially common in Scotland, where they dominate many of the native forests and are key to the local ecosystem.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-k6njjh">Pines have long been valued for their timber, which is strong, durable, and resistant to decay. Historically, pine wood has been used in construction, shipbuilding, and furniture-making. Pine trees also produce resin, which has been used for medicinal purposes and in the production of turpentine. Their needles and cones play a significant role in supporting wildlife, providing food and shelter for many species.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ip3hfq">Ecologically, Pine trees contribute to soil stabilization and play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, making them important allies in the fight against climate change. Their adaptability means that Pine forests are likely to remain a central feature of the British landscape for generations to come, admired for their majestic appearance and ecological importance.</p> <div class="clear"></div></section> <section><div><h2>Pine trees in context</h2></div> <div class="databox"><div class="left"><table class="striped"><thead data-svelte-h="svelte-9c7ieg"><tr><th>Tree</th> <th>Max Age (y)</th> <th>Max Height (m)</th> <th>Est. number</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><span class="">Ash</span></td> <td>250</td> <td>35</td> <td>80 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Beech</span></td> <td>350</td> <td>40</td> <td>10 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Elm</span></td> <td>400</td> <td>35</td> <td>10 thousand</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Fir</span></td> <td>500</td> <td>60</td> <td>1 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="">Oak</span></td> <td>1000</td> <td>40</td> <td>120 million</td> </tr><tr><td><span class="selected">Pine</span></td> <td>500</td> <td>45</td> <td>100 million</td> </tr></tbody></table></div> <div class="right">  <div id="treemap" style="width: 340px; height: 340px; position: relative; margin: 24px auto 0 auto; " class="leaflet-container leaflet-touch leaflet-retina leaflet-fade-anim leaflet-grab leaflet-touch-drag leaflet-touch-zoom" tabindex="0"></div> <p class="caption">Pine trees in the UK</p></div></div></section> <section><h2 class="spacer">Questions about Pine trees</h2> <hr> <details><summary><b>How tall can Pine trees grow?</b></summary> <p>Pine trees can grow up to 45 meters tall, making them one of the tallest conifers in the UK.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What is the lifespan of a Pine tree?</b></summary> <p>Pine trees can live for up to 500 years, with some species living even longer.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>Where are Pine trees commonly found in the UK?</b></summary> <p>Pine trees are especially common in Scotland, where they form a significant part of the native forests.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>What are some common uses of Pine wood?</b></summary> <p>Pine wood is widely used in construction, furniture-making, and shipbuilding due to its strength and durability.</p></details> <hr><details><summary><b>How do Pine trees contribute to the environment?</b></summary> <p>Pine trees help stabilize soils, provide habitat for wildlife, and play a key role in carbon sequestration, helping to combat climate change.</p></details> <hr></section> <section><h2 class="spacer" data-svelte-h="svelte-6btogu">Other trees</h2> <ul><li><a href="ash">Ash</a></li><li><a href="beech">Beech</a></li><li><a href="elm">Elm</a></li><li><a href="fir">Fir</a></li><li><a href="oak">Oak</a></li><li><a href="pine">Pine</a></li></ul></section></section></main> <footer class="container" data-svelte-h="svelte-5to0xk"><hr> <p>2024</p></footer>
