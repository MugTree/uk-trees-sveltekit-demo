# Basic Sveltekit site

ðŸŒŽ https://mugtree.github.io/uk-trees-sveltekit-demo/

- Pico CSS speed up development
- Simple use of components
- Content created by AI (CGPT) and added to content folder (content.md and qanda.json)
- Images initially resized using ImageMagik (thumbnails are trickier than Hugo)
- Imagemagick allow for a similar effect to hugos crop although chatgpt had to help with that

  ```shell
  ./workings/image_sizing.sh
  ```

- Markdown usuage based on this https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog
