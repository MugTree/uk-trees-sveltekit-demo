Elms can grow up to 35 meters tall and live for hundreds of years. However, in the 20th century, the species was devastated by Dutch elm disease, caused by a fungus spread by bark beetles, which killed millions of trees across Europe and North America.</p> <p>Despite this, elm trees still hold a significant place in British culture and ecology. They were often planted along streets and in parks for their ornamental beauty and the shade they provide. Their strong, interlocking grain made elm wood useful in boatbuilding and furniture making, as it resists splitting even when wet. Although Dutch elm disease remains a challenge, some resistant varieties have been developed, offering hope for the future of this iconic tree.</p> <p>Today, conservationists continue to explore ways to protect and reintroduce elms to the British landscape. While much of the elm population has been lost, its legacy endures in older specimens and new plantings, and its role in supporting wildlife—such as providing habitat for butterflies and birds—remains significant.</p>",1);function h(e){var t=n();i(4),a(e,t)}export{h as default,d as metadata};
