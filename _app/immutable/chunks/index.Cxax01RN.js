They are evergreen, maintaining their foliage year-round, and are easily recognized by their conical shape, straight trunks, and soft needle-like leaves. Fir trees are commonly found in cooler, upland regions, thriving in Scotlandâ€™s forests and other mountainous areas.</p> <p>Fir trees play a significant ecological role by providing shelter for wildlife and contributing to soil stability. Their wood is valued for construction, paper production, and furniture making, known for being strong yet lightweight. Firs also have a prominent cultural presence, especially as Christmas trees, symbolizing winter and endurance.</p> <p>As climate change impacts the environment, fir trees face both challenges and opportunities. Rising temperatures may threaten some populations, while others might benefit from the changing conditions. Fir trees remain an essential part of British forests, their towering presence a testament to the resilience of nature in the face of evolving landscapes.</p>",1);function p(e){var t=a();n(4),r(e,t)}export{p as default,m as metadata};
