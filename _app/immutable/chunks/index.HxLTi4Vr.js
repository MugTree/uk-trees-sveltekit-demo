Known for its evergreen foliage, pines can grow up to 45 meters tall and live for over 500 years. Pine trees are especially common in Scotland, where they dominate many of the native forests and are key to the local ecosystem.</p> <p>Pines have long been valued for their timber, which is strong, durable, and resistant to decay. Historically, pine wood has been used in construction, shipbuilding, and furniture-making. Pine trees also produce resin, which has been used for medicinal purposes and in the production of turpentine. Their needles and cones play a significant role in supporting wildlife, providing food and shelter for many species.</p> <p>Ecologically, Pine trees contribute to soil stabilization and play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, making them important allies in the fight against climate change. Their adaptability means that Pine forests are likely to remain a central feature of the British landscape for generations to come, admired for their majestic appearance and ecological importance.</p>",1);function d(e){var i=o();n(4),a(e,i)}export{d as default,p as metadata};
