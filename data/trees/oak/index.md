The oak tree (Quercus robur) is a symbol of strength and endurance in the UK, often living for over 500 years, with some trees reaching ages of over 1,000 years. Oaks are a keystone species in British woodlands, supporting a vast array of wildlife, from insects to birds and mammals. Standing tall at up to 40 meters, the oak is instantly recognizable by its broad canopy and deeply grooved bark.

Historically, oak wood was highly prized for its strength and resistance to rot, making it the material of choice for building ships, houses, and furniture. The tree also has a strong presence in British culture, often associated with wisdom and knowledge. Many historic oaks in the UK are considered ancient monuments, with stories and legends entwined around their long lives.

Today, oaks are cherished not only for their beauty but also for their vital role in supporting biodiversity. The tree’s acorns provide food for numerous species, while its leaves and branches offer shelter. The oak’s majestic presence in British forests ensures it remains a symbol of the natural world’s enduring power and resilience.
