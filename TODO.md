# Basic Sveltekit site

- Pico CSS speed up development
- Basic use of components
- Content created by AI (CGPT) and added to content folder (content.md and qanda.json)
- Images initially resized using ImageMagik (thumbnails are trickier than Hugo)
  Imagemagick allow for a similar effect to hugos crop although chatgpt had to help with that

## Issues

Had to create intermediate +page.js files to return the page content
